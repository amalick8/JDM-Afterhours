# 🚗 JDM Afterhours  

## 📚 Overview  
JDM Afterhours is a fully-functional community forum built for my WEB102 Final Project.  
Users can create posts about their favorite cars, add images, leave comments, and engage with others through upvotes.  
The app is powered by **React + Supabase**, and styled with a clean neon theme inspired by JDM night culture.
